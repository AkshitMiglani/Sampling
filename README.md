# Sampling
### The given Jupyter Notebook performs sampling on Credit Card Fraud Dataset
#### 5 different samples are created after balancing the dataset which includes :
### Simple Random Sampling
### Stratified Sampling
### Systematic Sampling
### Cluster Sampling 
### Multi Stage Sampling
#### 5 different Machine Learning models are applied to these samples, these models include:
### Extreme Gradient Boosting
### Random Forest Classifier
### Support Vector Machines
### Adaptive Boosting
### Logistic Regression Classifier
#### At the end the accuracies of these models on different samples are compared
